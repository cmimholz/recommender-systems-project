# Recommender Systems Project
Recommender System for Deezer

The aim of the project is to develop an recommendation system for Deezer, a music streaming service with over 43 million tracks. By analysing approximately 8 million listening histories, an algorithm will be developed that predicts whether a user will listen to a recommended track for more than 30 seconds. We develop our own algorithm and compare it with existing approaches.
